# Hey there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Kamand, currently a master's student in Information Technology Engineering - Network Science at Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran. I have a deep interest in network science, machine learning, and recommendation systems. My current research focuses on community detection in complex networks, fashion recommender systems, and graph analysis.

- 🧑‍🎓 **Research Assistant** at Tarbiat Modares University under the supervision of Dr. Babak Teimourpour.
- 🎓 **M.Sc.** in Information Technology Engineering (Network Science), with a thesis on hybrid deep learning fashion recommendation models.

Feel free to explore my projects related to:

## 📂 New Repository: [Sentiment-Driven Community Detection in a Network of Perfume Preferences](https://github.com/Kalashi-Saed-Collaborations/SentimentDrivenCommunityDetection)

This repository is part of our collaborative efforts, presenting datasets and methodologies used in our paper *"Sentiment-Driven Community Detection in a Network of Perfume Preferences."* We apply sentiment analysis and community detection techniques to analyze perfume preferences based on positive user reviews, uncovering shared consumer preferences in the fragrance industry.
